Foraging Bot. Instructions to use: 1. Use koordmaker to make a custom route starting from Hearth Fire. 2. Write .config file with res of forageables you want it to pick up (Save in scripts folder). 3. Enter custom route and config names on text fields and start it. Hearth Fire should be start of the route. Stores forageables in small chests near HF. If chests are full or there are none, it will stop. Purus Cor does not give you any other advice on how to use this and discourages botting. (He might fix bugs though) USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
