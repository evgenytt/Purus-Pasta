paginae/exp/quenching=You drink deep and greedily in full, dank, draughts, as visions of mist and Huldra dance within the theatre of your mind's eye.

paginae/exp/roaringfire=You are at the end of your efforts when, from crooked tinder set before you, there suddenly leaps, born of a single spark, a mighty Worm of flames blazing, wrapped in manes of soot and crimson.

paginae/exp/talkingtree = {尚未翻译} For some reason some power higher than yourself has compelled you to seek out this tree, and it is to your great amazement that you hear -- directionless, as if in echo from everywhere and nowhere -- it speak to you in a soft, seductive voice.

paginae/exp/thesymbel = {尚未翻译} It is not every meal that feels like a grand banquet held in a well-lit Hall, in the company of Kings, to symphonies of blowing horns and roaring fires, flowing with mead, but this one does.

paginae/skills/rage=$i{"Insults fell on his mind,\nLike sparks on wet leaves,\nUntil the leaves, one day, were dry.}\n\nYou've had quite enough, and someone is going to get it hard and fast. Rage allows you to initiate combat with other Hearthlings.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n

paginae/skills/silk=$i{"Ratjik's shirt was sewn,\nNot from fibre, nor hide,\nNot from animal, nor plant,\nWhat stuff made Ratjik's shirt?"}\n\n你一直把时间花在桑树上，还学会了制丝和处理丝。养蚕蛾，将它们的卵放在晒台上，给蚕喂桑叶，以及剥茧抽丝。
paginae/skills/srv = $i{"Kodving broke the ice,\nSkarm drew him up,\nLogi saved them both."}\n\nThey say that the burning longings in the back of every Hearthling's mind are the ancient lores of Firemaking, and of Walking the Land & Wild. Any Hearthling who has passed through the Evergreen, and been burned into the world, knows how to build fire and shelter, provided she finds the right materials.
paginae/skills/steelmaking=$i{"Born in flame,\nYet cold and silent,\nThirsting for blood.\nWho am I?"}\n\nThe embers of your forge have run glowing red hot, and from them now spring the strangest, most wonderful materials. You have learned how to make steel in steel crucibles, and also enjoy greater success at forging wrought iron.

paginae/skills/swim=$i{"Nine drops of rain-water,\nHe carried,\nOver land and black seas."}\n\nYou know how to get yourself out on deep water, which unfortunately carries with it the risk of never getting back alive to the shallows again. Death by drowning is a real risk for the unwary, and Hearthlings need a high "Constitution" value to swim for any considerable durations of time.
paginae/skills/tanning=$i{"And it gleamed in the sun,\nTheir polished armor made,\nOf red and purple leathers."}\n\nYou have learned the odorous but rewarding trade of turning prepared animal hides into leather. Build a "Tanning Tub", fill it with "Tanning Fluid", and place your hides in it.

paginae/skills/tools = $i{"Fashioned alone,\nBy fire at night,\nWith fire in mind,\nThree Ashen staves."}\n\nThey say that some mysterious forms are eternal lodestars written into the firmament of the Hearth. You think you could make a Stone Axe for yourself if you found the right materials.
paginae/skills/tres=$i{"In the black of night,\nAlgaur found a hidden path,\nThrough the briar-patch,\nTo deep, and secret places."}\n\nYour feet have begun wandering to the strangest places, ending up where they really have no business of ending up. Trespassing allows you to manipulate claimed things without permission, for example to look in containers.\n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down.
paginae/skills/tunneling=$i{"Caroubdin, High King\nDemanded of his mountain realm,\nIn the third month of the Conflux,\nRed Gold, and Blue steel."}\n\nYou have begun getting to know the mountain, its ways and means, and its cruel, fickle whims. You may construct stone columns to support your mining operations, and you find better ores when mining.
paginae/skills/vandal = $i{"The Skarm was forded by the late solstice,\nThe Heiskarl brought two by six ships.\nThe city was sacked.}\n\nSomething deep inside of you has begun yearning to see the world burn. You may destroy objects, and otherwise perform deleterious actions, on claims, without permission. \n\nBeware that each breach of the Hearthlaw leaves a Crime Scent -- which can be used to track you down -- and that being an outlaw prevents your character from being logged out for some time after the offense.\n
paginae/skills/wheelwrighting=$i{"Creaking along,\nIn mud-swollen tracks,\nBut steady,\nAnd sturdy,\nTurns the Wheel of Seasons."}\n\n你已经搞懂了怎么造出用在拖车、独轮车、诸如此类的上面的轮子。
paginae/skills/winemaking=$i{"In autumn vineyards,\nDrunk with song and laughter,\nAnd bittersweet juice,\nRed with love and promise."}\n\n你尝一个葡萄，就知道它熟没熟，适合不适合酿酒；还知道怎么培育葡萄、榨成汁酿成葡萄酒。秘诀？在酒坛里发酵葡萄汁，然后存在木桶里。
paginae/skills/woodsmanship=$i{"In the depth of winter,\nLie hidden away,\nAlong secret trails,\nThe seeds of spring."}\n\n你在野外行走有些日子了，对其很熟悉。你植树时有更高的成功率。
paginae/skills/wzm=$i{"Wicked portents,\nA black ash dripping with blood.\nAnd the entrails whisper\nOf lies and deceit."}\n\n你开始向往更多的东西。野心是步入控制之路的第一步，而且并非没有结果。
paginae/skills/yeomanry=$i{"Kolbjorn first broke the land around the Veitvast,\nHis family now sits in unbroken line by that water,\nTheir Halls ringing with mead and laughter."}\n\n你已经对这个世界施加了足够的影响，要考虑它的某些部分要归你所有。你可以建造领地图腾了，并且可以占据其周围地块作为私人领地。
